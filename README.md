# QSD-Webshop

During my QSD internship, I had the privilege of working on the development of a web application called QSD Shop. I worked as frontend.This project provided me with valuable hands-on experience in utilizing React with TypeScript for the frontend development. Technologies that are used are: FRONTEND(React+typescript) and for BACKEND(Laravel PHP). We gained valuable experience in team work, communication GitHub and Trello.

Description: A webshop application intended for selling a variety of men's, women's, and children's clothing.

Goal: The project goal is to create a reliable and user-friendly technical system that enables an intuitive, fun, and secure online shopping experience. The QSD Shop should work round the clock to deliver complete item-related and order-related information. Also, online payment has to be enabled.

NOTE: 
The application is hosted locally, so for the running application is required to clone backend and frontend.
